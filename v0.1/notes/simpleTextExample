Simple Test Example

Use the Single File Ubuntu 18 Flavor found in /executable/singlefile/Ubuntu18

Put that share file there into an empty directory

Create a subdirectory there with the name "test"

Put into the "test" directory whatever files you want to have compressed

Open the terminal in that directory

execute this command:
./share compress test test

This will create a test.share file in this directory (the first argument after compress being the file name, second the folder to compress)

To decompress, first rename the subdirectory to test_old or remove completely.
Then execute this command
./share decompress test.share .

This will create the subdirectory "test" again with the decompressed files.

The first agrument is the share archive, the second is the output directory path. It wil create a subdirectory in it with the name of the archive as folder name. (If it already exists, share will abort and put out a warning. I did not want share to possibly overwrite any existing files)
